🌌 Drei in React Three Fiber

Drei is a helper library for React Three Fiber that gives you ready-made 3D components.
Think of it as a toolbox full of prebuilt magic props so you don’t reinvent the cube every time. 🧰✨

Instead of writing raw Three.js setup again and again, you import from Drei and move faster.
npm i react-three-fiber
npm i @react-three/drei# react-3js-wolf
